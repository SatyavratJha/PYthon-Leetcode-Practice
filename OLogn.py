# 2^3 = 8
# log2 8 = 3
# log sub 2 of 8 equals 3 same as 2 power of 3  equals 8
# 2 to WHAT powers equals 8 i.e, it is 3rd power
# how many times you have to take the number 8 and devide by the 2 to get down to one item. i.e, 3 times
# log2 1,073,741,824 = 31
# graph of O(logn) is very flat and very efficient not as flat and as efficient as O(1) but much efficient and flat as compared to O(n^2) and O(n) and O(nlogn)
# O(nlogn) is the most efficient that we can make in sorting algorithms  like merge sort or quick sort. 
# There are sorting algorithms that can sort number more efficient that O(nlogn) but we're going to sort strings or various types of data, then O(nlogn) is the most efficient that we can make sorting algorithm
